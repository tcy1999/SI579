A School of Pharmacy, the nation's first school of pharmacy at a state university, was established on December 29, 1876, by Albert B. Prescott. As the first dean, Dr. Prescott introduced the concept of basic science education as a prerequisite to practical training for those pursuing a pharmacy degree."

    description: 'Space on the University of Michigan campus became inadequate to accommodate the post-war growth of the University. In anticipation of this growing need, the Regents had begun to acquire farmland property on the sloping hills lying just to the northeast of the Huron River. Although there were some early thoughts given to relocating the School of Education, Natural Resources, Music, and Fine Arts to the North Campus, the construction of the Phoenix Memorial Project soon re-purposed the site for engineering research. More specifically, the early plans for the North Campus included the Cooley Memorial Laboratory to house the electronics research associated with the Willow Run Laboratories, the Phoenix Memorial Laboratory, the Automotive Laboratory, and a storage library. The development of the rest of the campus would proceed as needs arose and funds were secured. Possible projects suggested for the long-range future included a fine arts center where teaching facilities in music, theater, television, architecture, and design could be concentrated; residence halls and multiple-housing units for both single and married students, and staff; and facilities for the study of natural resources.'
